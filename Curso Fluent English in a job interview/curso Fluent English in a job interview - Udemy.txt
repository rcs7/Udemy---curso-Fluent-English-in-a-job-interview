I study at UFPE. There I learned several things. Obviously not everything I remember. For example, if you put a question of analytical geometry that I saw in the first period, I may not even be able to do it. But if I take a subject of analytical geometry I will be able to understand much faster than the first time I saw the question. So I usually say that there I learned to learn. To overcome limits. Overcoming difficulties.
